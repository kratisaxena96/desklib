                    1. INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL TERMS
                </h6>
                <p>
                    Welcome to <a href="/">www.desklib.com</a>. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at info@desklib.com.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Desklib, Inc. (“Desklib,” “we” and “us”).   You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services.  Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services.  These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Desklib <a href="{% url 'privacypolicy' %}">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="{% url 'honorcode' %}">Honor Code</a> and <a href="{% url 'copyright' %}">Copyright Dispute Policy</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the purposes of these Terms, “User” means anyone who accesses and/or registers for our Services, including without limitation students, Instructors, or other users. “Instructor” means Experts (as defined below), tutors, and anyone who provides answers, online courses, instruction, tutoring and learning services through our Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Please be advised: these Terms contain provisions that govern how claims that you and Desklib have against each other can be brought (see below). These provisions will, with limited exception, require that you submit claims you have against Desklib to binding and final arbitration on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class, group or representative action or proceeding.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Will these Terms ever change?</strong><br>
                    We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the <a href="/">desklib.com</a> website, by sending you an email and/or by some other means.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services.  If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What about my privacy?</strong><br>

                    The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

                </h6>
                <p>
                    <strong>Registration and Security</strong><br>
                    To use some aspects of the Services, you may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“Desklib User ID”). If you are accessing the Services through a third party site or service (such as “Facebook” or “Google”), we may require that your Desklib User ID be the same as your user name for such third party site or service. You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your Desklib User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission. You may only create one account with us. If your account has been suspended or terminated, you may not open another account with us. If you access the Service through a third party site or service, you will provide your third party account credentials to us, and you are consenting to have the information in those accounts transmitted into your Desklib account, and you agree that you shall only use accounts owned by you, and not by any other person or entity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms, in which case the references to “you” or “your” or the like other than in this sentence, refer to such organization or entity. If you are a parent, guardian, or other person who enables a child under the age of 13 to access the Services, you agree to stand in the shoes of such child for the purposes of making us whole in case of damages or indemnification that could properly lie against a child, if not for his or her age. The Services are intended for use by you only if you are 13 years of age or older.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Permitted Use</strong><br>
                    You will only use the Services for your own personal use (and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party), and only in a manner that complies with all laws, rules (government, school, or otherwise), and regulations (collectively “Applicable Laws”) that apply to you. You may not resell or make any commercial use of the Services or any Content (defined below) therein (other than your own Submissions (defined below), subject to the non-exclusive license you grant to us). Any Content you access through the Services is licensed, not sold to you, regardless of the use of the term “purchase” herein.

                <p>
                    <strong>We are not responsible for Content</strong><br>
                    We are not responsible for editing, modifying, filtering, screening, monitoring, endorsing or guaranteeing any Content.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Content is to be used for general information purposes only, not as a substitute for in-person evaluation or specific professional advice.  Communications facilitated by the Services do not create client-professional relationships and are not the subject of any associated privileges or confidentiality protections.

                <p>
                    <strong>Protection of Content</strong><br>
                    The Content is protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including Desklib’s) rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You understand that Desklib owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.

                <p>
                    The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Connectivity Costs and Equipment</strong><br>

<!--                    <strong>Access to Tutors:</strong> The Services may include, at our discretion, access to Tutors who teach online courses or provide instructional materials and/or tutoring. Tutors are not employees or agents of Desklib. We solely facilitate the transaction between you and the Tutor. We are not involved in the conversation between you and Tutors and we do not refer you to or endorse or recommend particular Tutors. Emergency questions and crisis situations (particularly regarding medical or mental health issues) should be directed immediately by telephone or in-person to qualified professionals (e.g., in the U.S., call 911). The Services are not the appropriate venue to deal with such questions or situations. The laws, regulations, other governing authorities, standards, practices and procedures that apply to your particular question may differ depending on your location and information typically discovered through in-person evaluations or visits. For example, Tutors in some categories may be licensed, certified, educated, employed by or have experience in only particular jurisdictions.-->

                <p>
                    <strong>Will Desklib ever change the Services?</strong><br>
                    We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Does the Desklib Service cost anything?</strong><br>
